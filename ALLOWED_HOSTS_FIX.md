# Railway ALLOWED_HOSTS Fix

## Issue Identified âœ…
```
django.core.exceptions.DisallowedHost: Invalid HTTP_HOST header: 'healthcheck.railway.app'. You may need to add 'healthcheck.railway.app' to ALLOWED_HOSTS.
```

## Root Cause
Railway's health check system uses `healthcheck.railway.app` as the host header, but this domain wasn't included in Django's `ALLOWED_HOSTS` setting.

## âœ… **FIX APPLIED**

### Updated ALLOWED_HOSTS
```python
ALLOWED_HOSTS = [
    "localhost",
    "127.0.0.1",
    "tilenet.onrender.com",
    "web-production-c1b96.up.railway.app",  # Your specific Railway domain
    "healthcheck.railway.app",  # Railway health check domain
    ".railway.app",  # All Railway domains
    ".up.railway.app",  # All Railway domains
]
```

### Updated CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS
```python
CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS = [
    "https://tilenet.onrender.com",
    "https://web-production-c1b96.up.railway.app",
    "https://healthcheck.railway.app",
    "https://*.railway.app",
    "https://*.up.railway.app",
    # ... other origins
]
```

## ðŸŽ¯ **What This Fixes**

- âœ… **Health check will pass** - Railway can now access `/`
- âœ… **All Railway domains allowed** - Any Railway subdomain will work
- âœ… **CSRF protection** - Forms will work properly
- âœ… **No more DisallowedHost errors**

## ðŸš€ **Expected Results**

After pushing this fix:
1. **Health check passes** âœ…
2. **Deployment succeeds** âœ…
3. **All endpoints work** âœ…
4. **No more host errors** âœ…

## ðŸ“‹ **Test Endpoints**

Once deployed, test these:
- `https://web-production-c1b96.up.railway.app/` - Health check
- `https://web-production-c1b96.up.railway.app/test/` - Simple test
- `https://web-production-c1b96.up.railway.app/status/` - Status info
- `https://web-production-c1b96.up.railway.app/debug/` - Debug info

## ðŸŽ‰ **This Should Be The Final Fix!**

The ALLOWED_HOSTS issue was the last piece of the puzzle. Now:
- âœ… WeasyPrint works
- âœ… Port handling works
- âœ… Startup script works
- âœ… Health check will work
- âœ… All Railway domains allowed

Push this fix and your Railway deployment should work perfectly! ðŸš€
